## Sebastian Waelchli
**Mechanical Engineer | Tech Enthusiast | Hobby Baker**


I am a Houston-based engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering. I work in Project Management for rotating equipment that is used several industries ranging from traditional oil & gas applications to renewable technologies such as heatpumps.

### Technical Interests
Beyond my professional world of mechanical engineering, I am a dedicated **homelabber**. This website is a result of this hobby. Everything you see here is hosted on my homeserver.

* **Virtualization:** Managing services via Proxmox and Docker.
* **Self-Hosting:** Running local instances of serveral applicaitons that help me in my daily life.
* **Development:** Building custom tools and scripts, often shared on my GitHub.

### Projects & Philosophy
This site serves as a central hub for my technical experiments. Whether it's a deep dive into engineering formulas or a guide on configuring a new Docker container. I also like to mix in some of my other interest such as baking.



### Beyond the Screen
When I'm not optimizing a server (or fixing something I broke attempting it), you can also find me:

* **Baking:** Perfecting the art of sourdough bread.
* **Running:** Training for my next 5K (looking at you, Art Car IPA 5K!).
* **Gaming:** Navigating strategy maps in *Europa Universalis* or *Heroes of Might and Magic*.
* **Learning:** Currently improving my Spanish through CCLS Houston.
