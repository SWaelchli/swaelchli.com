## Sebastian Waelchli
**Engineer | Tech Enthusiast | Problem Solver**


I am a Houston-based engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering. I work in Project Management for rotating equipment used several industries ranging from traditional oil & gas applications to renewable technologies such as heatpumps.

### Technical Interests
Beyond the world of mechanical engineering, I am a dedicated "homelabber." My digital workshop consists of:
* **Virtualization:** Managing services via Proxmox and Docker.
* **Self-Hosting:** Running local instances of Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, and managing networking with Caddy.
* **Development:** Building custom tools and scripts, often shared on my GitHub.

### Projects & Philosophy
This site serves as a central hub for my technical experiments. Whether it's a deep dive into engineering formulas or a guide on configuring a new Docker container, I believe in the "pure paper" philosophy: clean, readable, and focused on the content.



### Beyond the Screen
When I'm not optimizing a server or a turbine, you can find me:

* **Baking:** Perfecting the art of sourdough bread.
* **Running:** Training for my next 5K (looking at you, Art Car IPA 5K!).
* **Gaming:** Navigating strategy maps in *Europa Universalis* or *Heroes of Might and Magic*.
* **Learning:** Currently improving my Spanish through CCLS Houston.
