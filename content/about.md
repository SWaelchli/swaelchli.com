## Sebastian Waelchli
**Mechanical Engineer | Tech Enthusiast | Hobby Baker**

Hello there! :wave:

I am Sebastian, a Houston-based engineer with a background in Mechanical Engineering. In my professional life, I work in Project Management for rotating equipment used in industries ranging from traditional oil & gas to renewable technologies like industrial heat pumps. Engineering has always been more than just a job for me; I love the learning process involved in every new project and feel lucky to work with talented people from all over the world.

### Technical Interests
When I log off from the day job, the engineering doesn't always stop. This website is a direct product of my recent homelab obsession. If you’re seeing this, it means I’ve managed to make my home server behave itself (for now).

I plan on sharing more posts soon that describe my current setup and offer tips for anyone else going down the self-hosting rabbit hole.

### Why This Site Exists
This is my digital playground. You’ll find everything here from deep dives into engineering formulas to guides on how to bake a better sourdough loaf. I plan to use this space for whatever I’m currently tinkering with.


### Beyond the Screen
When I’m not optimizing a server (or frantically fixing a config file I broke), you can usually find me:

* **In the Kitchen:** Since both of my parents are trained chefs, high-quality food has always been a part of my life. Currently, I’m on a quest to perfect the sourdough loaf.
* **Outdoors:** I love spending time outdoors. Whether it's going on a walk, riding my bike or fishing.
* **Gaming:** I’ve always had a soft spot for a good strategy or simulation game. I don’t have as much time for it as I used to, but I still enjoy a session when I can.
* **Learning Spanish:** *Poco a poco.* I’m a native German speaker and am currently taking Spanish classes, trying to add a third language to the mix.
