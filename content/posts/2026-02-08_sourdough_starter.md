I just recently startet to get into baking.  After moving to Houston from Zurich more than 2 years ago, a craving for some fresh, crunchy, **delicous bread** became more and more apparent in me. That's why I decided to give baking a try and to make my own sour ough starter from scrach.

I like to share with you how you can make your own starter.

## 1. How to start?

All you need is:
- a container to store the sourdough starter. I personally use an old olive jar.
- unbleached flour. ( I use [Arthur Bread Flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/bread-flour) )
- water

### Day 1
Start by mixing 15 g of flour with 15 g of water.
Mix it together until it is a uniform mass
Store it in your container

### Day 2
After day 1 you will have 30 g of starter.
mix the starter with 30 g of flour and 30 g of water.
Mix it  and store it in your container

### Day 3

take 30 g of the starter from the prvious day and mix it with 30 g of water and flour.
The remaining starter can be discarded. Either throw it away or keep the discard to make verious things, such as pancakes, waffles. There are plenty of recipies out there.

### Day 4 to 10

Keep repeating the procedure from day 3.

## 2. When is the starter ready?

General rule of thump is that the starter is ready, when it rises to twice it's size.
I marked my jar with a sharpy after putting the the fed starter into the container each day. This way I was able to observe the groth of the starter compared to it's starting point.

**Be aware of false rise.**  
False rise typically apears arround 3. The starter can grow to 3 times it's size and you might think it is ready. This happens when bakteria is getting very active and causes this rise. 
However, we do not want bacteria to produce the gas. We want yeast. 
Keep feeding the starter every day and you will notice that the starter will stop growing this much. By day 4 or 5 the growth will be slowing down again.

Keep feeding it until the starter reaches a growth of 2 times it's original size.
When that is the case, you have a strong yeast culture in your starter. The starter will smell quite pleasently, yeasty. 
That's the moment when you can start using it to bake.


 ## 3. How to store the starter?

I store my starter in the fridge after waiting a 2-3 hours after feeding it.
Once a week I take it out and feed my starter with the usual 1-1-1 ration (30 g starerr, 30 g flour and 30 gwater)

In case I want to bake, I take out the starter the day before, feed it and let it sit on the kitchen counter overnight.
