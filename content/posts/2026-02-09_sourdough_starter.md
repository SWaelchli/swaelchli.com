I just recently started to get into baking. After moving to Houston from Zurich more than 2 years ago, a craving for some fresh, crunchy, **delicious** bread became more and more apparent to me. That's why I decided to give baking a try and to make my own sourdough starter from scratch.

I'd like to share with you how you can make your own starter.

## 1. How to start?

All you need is:
- A container to store the sourdough starter. I personally use an old olive jar.
- Unbleached flour (I use [King Arthur Bread Flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/bread-flour)).
- Water (I suggest to use filtered water in case your tap water has high levels of chlorine).

### Day 1
Start by mixing 15 g of flour with 15 g of water.
Mix it together until it is a uniform mass.
Store it in your container.

### Day 2
After day 1, you will have 30 g of starter.
Mix the starter with 30 g of flour and 30 g of water.
Mix it and store it in your container.

### Day 3
Take 30 g of the starter from the previous day and mix it with 30 g of water and flour.
The remaining starter can be discarded. 

We discard the starter away to avoid accumulating more and more starter, which in turn requires more an more flour to feed the starter.
Either throw it away or keep the discard to make various things, such as pancakes or waffles. There are plenty of recipes out there. I recommend not let your discard go to waste!

### Day 4 to 10
Keep repeating the procedure from day 3.

## 2. When is the starter ready?

The general rule of thumb is that the starter is ready when it rises to twice its size.
I marked my jar with a Sharpie after putting the fed starter into the container each day. This way, I was able to observe the growth of the starter compared to its starting point.

A popular test is the "Floar Tests". Take a spoon your starter and put in in a bowl filled with water. The starter is ready when it floats on the water.

**Be aware of false rise.** A false rise typically appears around day 3. The starter can grow to 3 times its size and you might think it is ready. This happens when bacteria are getting very active and causing this rise. 
However, we do not want bacteria to produce the gas. We want yeast. 
Keep feeding the starter every day and you will notice that the growth will slow down again. By day 4 or 5, the growth will be much less.

Keep feeding it until the starter reaches a growth of 2 times its original size.
When that is the case, you have a strong yeast culture in your starter. The starter will smell quite pleasant and yeasty. 
That's the moment when you can start using it to bake.

## 3. How to store the starter?

I store my starter in the fridge after waiting 2–3 hours after feeding it.
Once a week, I take it out and feed my starter with the usual 1:1:1 ratio (30 g starter, 30 g flour, and 30 g water).

In case I want to bake, I take out the starter the day before, feed it, and let it sit on the kitchen counter overnight.
