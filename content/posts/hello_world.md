Welcome to my personal corner of the web! 

After spending time playing arround with some coding projecs, I decided it was time to build a space that serves as both a portfolio and a digital playground. This site is hosted on my own **home server**, which is a project in itself.

### Why this site exists
My goal here is twofold:

1. **Programming & Engineering:** I use this site as a motivation to keep sharpening my coding skills, particularly with **Python**. You can expect to see smaller engineering tools, automation scripts, and documentation of my homelab experiments.
2. **Personal Interests:** Outside of the "binary" world, I’m a fan of **baking**—specifically the science and patience required for a perfect sourdough. I'll be sharing some of those projects here as well.

### What to expect
I plan to keep things simple. I’ll be posting:
* **Engineering Tools:** Snippets and calculators for technical tasks.
* **Homelab Guides:** Configurations for Docker, Caddy, and self-hosted apps like *Actual Budget*.
* **General "Playing Around":** Whatever technical curiosity catches my attention during the weekend.

Thanks for stopping by. If you want to connect, my **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** links are in the header!
